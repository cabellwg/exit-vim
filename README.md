# `exit-vim`

Vim is scary. Here are **7 FACTS** that **YOU DIDN'T KNOW** about Vim that will **SHOCK** you:
 - Black holes trap all matter that passes beyond their event horizon using Vim.
 - Maya Angelou wrote "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" when she was trying to get out of Vim.
 - Vim either voted for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, whomever you liked less.
 - The 2017 hit movie "Get Out" was inspired by Jordan Peele trying to exit Vim.

In 1976, black-hat basement hacker Bill Joy, cofounder of Sun Microsystems (and, by extension, the man responsible for all the evils of the Oracle Corporation) hacked together a quick piece of ransomware called Vi. The idea was simple: create a command line "utility" that holds developers hostage to their own code! Don't go pressing buttons – Vi is "powerful", which means it only takes a few keystrokes to accidentally delete an entire file! No, instead, you have to call an older developer, one who was around before the IDEs and GUI editors that "the kids are using these days". Instead of the classic scheme – writing unintelligible code for job security – he guaranteed thousands of COBOL developers their job security while they were transitioning to Java developers (and later JavaScript developers).
